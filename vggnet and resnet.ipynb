It has a deep architecture, with popular variants such as VGG16 and VGG19 containing 16 and 19 layers respectively.\nComponents: VGGNet employs:\nConvolutional layers (with small 3x3 filters)\nMax pooling layers (2x2)\nFully connected layers towards the end\nDesign Principles: VGGNet emphasizes depth and the use of smaller filters, leading to increased non-linearity while maintaining a simple structure.\nResNet:\n\nArchitecture: ResNet introduces skip connections, allowing for the creation of very deep networks (e.g., ResNet50, ResNet101). The architecture consists of stacks of residual blocks.\nComponents: Key components include:\nConvolutional layers\nBatch normalization\nActivation functions (ReLU)\nResidual connections (skip connections) that allow inputs to bypass one or more layers\nDesign Principles: The main principle of ResNet is to enable the training of much deeper networks without suffering from the vanishing gradient problem.",

This enables the training of networks with hundreds or even thousands of layers.\nIdentity Mapping: By allowing layers to learn the residual mapping, instead of directly learning the desired underlying mapping, ResNet can more effectively adjust to deeper architectures.\nImplications for Training: The use of residual connections leads to improved convergence rates, easier optimization, and better performance in very deep networks.",
