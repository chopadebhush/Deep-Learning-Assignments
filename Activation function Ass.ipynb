Role of Activation Functions in Neural Networks\n\nActivation functions introduce non-linearity to neural networks, which allows the model to learn and represent complex patterns in data. Without them, the network would behave like a linear model, no matter how many layers it had, limiting its ability to model complex real-world problems. Activation functions help control the output of neurons by determining whether a neuron should be activated or not based on the input it receives.\n\nLinear vs. Nonlinear Activation Functions:\n\nLinear Activation Function: A linear function does not introduce non-linearity. For instance, a function like \nùëì(ùë•)=ùë• f(x)=x produces the output proportional to its input. It‚Äôs not suitable for complex data because the composition of linear transformations is still linear, limiting the learning capacity of the network.\nNonlinear Activation Function: Introduces non-linearity to the model, allowing the network to learn from complex data. Examples include Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh functions. Nonlinearity is necessary for hidden layers, enabling the network to stack multiple layers to solve problems like image classification, natural language processing, etc.\nWhy Nonlinear Activation Functions are Preferred in Hidden Layers: Nonlinear activation functions allow for more expressive power in the neural network. With nonlinearities, neural networks can approximate complex functions, perform hierarchical feature extraction, and learn complex patterns in data. Linear activation in hidden layers would make the entire network equivalent to a linear function, regardless of depth.\n",

This centering effect in Tanh helps mitigate some issues related to training deep networks.\nTanh still suffers from the vanishing gradient problem, though less severe than Sigmoid.",
