The goal is to assign a label to every pixel in the image, making it easier for a machine to understand and analyze.\n\nImportance in Computer Vision: Image segmentation is crucial for several applications where detailed understanding of the image content is required. It helps in:\n\nObject Detection and Recognition: Helps identify and classify multiple objects within a scene by isolating individual objects.\nMedical Imaging: Used to segment organs, tumors, or tissues for diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgery assistance.\nAutonomous Vehicles: Essential for detecting roads, pedestrians, vehicles, and obstacles to make decisions in real time.\nImage Editing and Enhancement: Allows for precise manipulation of specific parts of an image.\nExamples of Tasks:\n\nAutonomous Driving: Segmenting road lanes, vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs.\nMedical Imaging: Segmenting MRI or CT scan images to detect tumors or anomalies.\nSatellite Image Analysis: Segmenting urban areas, water bodies, and vegetation for environmental monitoring.\n",
