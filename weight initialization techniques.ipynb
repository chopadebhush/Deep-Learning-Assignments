This results in very small weight updates for layers close to the input, making it difficult for the network to learn effectively. Specifically, the weights in the early layers are not adjusted meaningfully, and learning becomes very slow or even stagnant.\n\nEffect on Training: The vanishing gradient problem causes the network to stop learning or converge very slowly because the gradients for earlier layers vanish as they propagate backward, leading to poor model performance, especially in tasks involving long-term dependencies (e.g., RNNs).",
